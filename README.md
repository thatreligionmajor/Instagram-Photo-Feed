## Want to see the site run?
To run the preview in GitHub Codespaces:
```bash
$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```

- You can create as many HTML files as you want.
- You can also create CSS files and import them into your website using a `<link>` tag placed between the `<head></head>` tags, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ...
</head>
```
